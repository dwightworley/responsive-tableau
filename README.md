An easy way to create responsive Tableau data visualizations

Read my guest post on creating responsive Tableau visualizations on the Tableau blog: http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/blog/2014/11/making-tableau-responsive-2681

This code is what I have used to create a responsive Tableau viz. It involves creating multiple dashboards for a project in Tableau (each sized according to a specific target screen size) and using CSS to display the appropriate viz for each device. Please read the blog post for more details.

Copy the file and add your embed links in the appropriate locations. You may need to tweak the CSS if you sized your views differently.
